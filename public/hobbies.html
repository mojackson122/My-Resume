<h1>My Hobbies</h1>
<p>My favoite things to do when I am not coding are to go to concerts, hiking, and traveling. I also consider myself somewhat of a photographer, so I enjoy showing my skills in that area too. My other hobbies are playing video games and trying to create a Heisman winning Quarterback on College Football 26. I love sports so you can catch me on the weekends at a game or watching one. </p>
