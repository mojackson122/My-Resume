<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I’m a self-taught web developer with a passion for building clean, modern, and user-friendly websites. My journey
started with curiosity and late nights learning to code, and quickly turned into a full-on commitment to mastering the
craft.
  Over time, I’ve taught myself how to bring ideas to life online—whether it’s designing sleek layouts, optimizing
  performance, or writing code that just works. I thrive on solving problems, learning new technologies, and creating
  digital experiences that not only look great but function flawlessly.</p>

<h2>What I Bring To the table</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Front-End Development: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and responsive design that makes sites shine on any device.</li>
  <li>Back-End Skills: Experience with frameworks and tools that keep projects scalable and efficient.</li>
  <li>Problem-Solving Mindset: I don’t just code—I troubleshoot, refine, and push for better solutions.</li>
  <li>Continuous Learning: Tech moves fast, and I stay sharp by constantly exploring new languages, frameworks, and best
  practices.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Beyond the Code</h2>
<p>I believe websites aren’t just digital placeholders—they’re opportunities to connect, showcase ideas, and build trust.
That’s why I focus on every detail, from user experience to performance optimization, so the final product makes a
lasting impact.</p>
